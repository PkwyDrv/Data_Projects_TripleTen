# IMDB Movie Review Sentiment Analysis: Text Classification

This project aims to classify IMDB movie reviews as positive or negative using machine learning techniques for text sentiment analysis. The goal is to build a predictive model that can accurately determine the sentiment of a movie review based on the text.

## Project Overview

The Jupyter notebook demonstrates the entire workflow for text sentiment analysis, including:
- Data preprocessing and text cleaning
- Feature extraction using natural language processing techniques
- Implementing machine learning algorithms for text classification
- Evaluating model performance to ensure accurate sentiment predictions

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains IMDB movie reviews, with each review labeled as either positive or negative. The dataset includes:
- **Text reviews:** User-written movie reviews from the IMDB website
- **Sentiment labels:** Indicating whether a review is positive (1) or negative (0)

The data is used to train machine learning models that predict the sentiment of movie reviews based on the text content.

## Key Objectives

- **Classify movie reviews:** Develop machine learning models to categorize reviews as positive or negative based on their content.
- **Optimize model performance:** Use various techniques such as hyperparameter tuning to achieve the best accuracy in sentiment prediction.
- **Analyze text data:** Understand which features or words significantly contribute to predicting review sentiment.

## Machine Learning Techniques Used

The project employs various machine learning techniques for text classification, including:
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, and text vectorization (TF-IDF, Bag-of-Words).
- **Classification algorithms:** Models such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) are used for sentiment analysis.
- **Hyperparameter tuning:** Using grid search or other optimization methods to find the best model parameters.
- **Model evaluation:** Assessing performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Tools and Libraries

The following tools and libraries are used in this project:
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and handling
- **NumPy:** For numerical computations
- **Scikit-learn:** For implementing machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit):** For text processing and cleaning
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn:** For visualizing data distributions and model performance
