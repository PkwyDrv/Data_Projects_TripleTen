# Insurance Benefits Data Obfuscation Using Linear Algebra

This project demonstrates how linear algebra techniques can be applied to obfuscate sensitive insurance benefits data. The goal is to transform the original data in a way that preserves privacy while allowing for meaningful analysis. The Jupyter notebook showcases data obfuscation methods using linear algebra operations, such as matrix transformations and pseudorandom number generation.

## Project Overview

The notebook covers the process of using linear algebra to obfuscate insurance benefits data, including:
- Understanding the original dataset and identifying sensitive information
- Applying linear algebra transformations to anonymize the data
- Evaluating the effectiveness of data obfuscation
- Demonstrating how obfuscated data can be used for analysis without compromising privacy

## Dataset

The dataset consists of insurance benefits data, which may include:
- Customer demographics (e.g., age, gender, income level)
- Benefit details (e.g., coverage amounts, claim history)
- Policy information (e.g., type of insurance, premium amounts)

The data contains sensitive information that requires obfuscation to protect customer privacy while maintaining the utility of the dataset for analysis.

## Key Objectives

- **Obfuscate sensitive data:** Use linear algebra techniques to anonymize insurance benefits data while preserving the structure and statistical properties.
- **Evaluate data privacy:** Ensure that the original sensitive information cannot be easily reconstructed from the obfuscated data.
- **Maintain data utility:** Allow for meaningful analysis on the transformed dataset to support business insights without exposing private information.

## Linear Algebra Techniques Used

The project employs various linear algebra techniques, such as:
- **Matrix transformations:** Including matrix multiplication and addition for data transformation
- **Orthogonal matrices:** To ensure that transformations maintain the dataset's structural properties
- **Pseudorandom number generation:** For creating noise matrices to add to the data and further obfuscate sensitive information
- **Dimensionality reduction:** Using techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce data complexity before obfuscation

## Tools and Libraries

The following tools and libraries are used in this project:
- **NumPy:** For linear algebra operations and matrix manipulations
- **Pandas:** For data handling and preprocessing
- **Scikit-learn:** For techniques like PCA and evaluating data transformation
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn:** For visualizing original and obfuscated data to compare effectiveness
