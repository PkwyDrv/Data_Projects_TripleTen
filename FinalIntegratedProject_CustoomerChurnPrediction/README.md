# Customer Churn Prediction

This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a business using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a predictive model that accurately identifies customers who are likely to leave the company, enabling proactive retention strategies.

## Project Overview

The Jupyter notebook demonstrates the complete workflow for predicting customer churn, including:
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data characteristics
- Training various machine learning models for churn prediction
- Evaluating model performance and selecting the best model
- Providing actionable insights for reducing customer churn

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about customers, including:
- **Demographic details:** Age, gender, and location
- **Account information:** Subscription type, tenure, and contract type
- **Service usage:** Data on usage patterns for different services
- **Churn status:** Indicating whether the customer has churned (1) or not (0)

The data is used to train machine learning models to predict the likelihood of customer churn.

## Key Objectives

- **Predict customer churn:** Develop models to identify customers who are likely to leave the company.
- **Improve customer retention:** Use the model's predictions to target at-risk customers with retention efforts.
- **Analyze churn factors:** Understand which features contribute the most to customer churn.

## Machine Learning Techniques Used

The project uses various machine learning techniques, including:
- **Data preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing relationships between features and churn.
- **Classification algorithms:** Models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) are used for prediction.
- **Hyperparameter tuning:** Using grid search or random search to optimize model parameters.
- **Model evaluation:** Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC are used to assess model performance.

## Tools and Libraries

The following tools and libraries are used in this project:
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and preprocessing
- **NumPy:** For numerical computations
- **Scikit-learn:** For implementing machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn:** For visualizing data distributions, correlations, and model performance

## How to Run the Notebook

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PkwyDrv/Data_Projects_TripleTen.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

3. Install the required dependencies (if not already installed)

4. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook TT_final_project.ipynb
   
5. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the models, and evaluate their performance.

##  Findings
The analysis provides insights such as:

- The most important features contributing to customer churn (e.g., contract type, tenure, and service usage)
- The effectiveness of different machine learning algorithms for predicting churn
- Recommendations for targeted retention strategies based on the model's predictions

## Future Work
Possible future enhancements include:

- Implementing more advanced models, such as XGBoost or deep learning approaches
- Integrating additional data sources, such as customer feedback or social media activity, to improve prediction accuracy
- Developing a real-time churn prediction system for proactive retention efforts
