# Time Series Forecasting: Taxi Driver Demand Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the demand for taxi drivers in a given area using time series forecasting techniques. Accurate demand forecasting helps taxi services allocate resources effectively, ensuring that the right number of drivers are available when needed.

## Project Overview

The Jupyter notebook demonstrates the complete workflow for forecasting taxi driver demand, including:
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Time series analysis and visualization
- Implementing various forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet)
- Evaluating model performance to identify the best forecasting approach

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes time series data on taxi demand, such as:
- Timestamps (e.g., hourly or daily records)
- Number of taxi rides requested or fulfilled in a given time period
- External factors, if available (e.g., weather conditions, holidays, events)

The data is used to train time series models that predict future taxi demand based on historical patterns.

## Key Objectives

- **Forecast taxi demand:** Develop time series models to predict the number of taxi rides needed in the near future.
- **Optimize resource allocation:** Use the forecasts to help taxi services allocate drivers more efficiently.
- **Analyze demand patterns:** Understand the temporal patterns in taxi demand to improve business strategies.

## Time Series Forecasting Techniques Used

The project utilizes various time series forecasting techniques, including:
- **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average):** For capturing linear trends and seasonality in the data.
- **SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA):** Extends ARIMA to model seasonal patterns.
- **Prophet:** A forecasting model developed by Facebook that handles seasonality and holidays well.
- **Evaluation metrics:** Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are used to assess the models' forecasting accuracy.

## Tools and Libraries

The following tools and libraries are used in this project:
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and preprocessing
- **NumPy:** For numerical computations
- **Statsmodels:** For implementing ARIMA and SARIMA models
- **Prophet:** For forecasting demand with the Prophet library
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn:** For visualizing time series data and model predictions
- **Scikit-learn:** For additional data preprocessing and evaluation metrics
