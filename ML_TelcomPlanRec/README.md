# Telecom Plan Recommendation Using Machine Learning

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to recommend optimal telecom plans for customers based on their usage patterns. The analysis involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation to predict the best plan for different user segments.

## Project Overview

The Jupyter notebook showcases the end-to-end process of building a machine learning model for recommending telecom plans, including:
- Data preprocessing and feature selection
- Training various machine learning models
- Evaluating model performance
- Providing actionable insights to improve the recommendation system

## Dataset

The dataset contains information about telecom users, including:
- Customer demographics (e.g., age, location)
- Usage patterns (e.g., call duration, data usage)
- Historical plan details and customer preferences

The data is used to train a machine learning model that predicts the most suitable plan for each customer.

## Key Objectives

- **Build a predictive model:** Train machine learning models to recommend telecom plans based on customer data.
- **Evaluate model performance:** Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model effectiveness.
- **Optimize recommendations:** Fine-tune the model to provide more accurate plan suggestions and maximize customer satisfaction.

## Machine Learning Techniques Used

The project employs several machine learning techniques, including:
- **Data preprocessing:** Handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical data
- **Model selection:** Using algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting
- **Hyperparameter tuning:** Applying techniques like Grid Search and Random Search to optimize model performance
- **Evaluation metrics:** Analyzing the results using classification metrics to choose the best model

## Tools and Libraries

The following tools and libraries are used:
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis
- **Scikit-learn:** For machine learning algorithms and evaluation
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn:** For visualizing data and model performance
- **NumPy:** For numerical operations
