# Oil Mining Geolocation Analysis Using Linear Regression

This project focuses on predicting the potential yield of oil wells based on their geolocation characteristics using linear regression. The analysis aims to help identify the most promising locations for oil extraction, improving the efficiency and profitability of oil mining operations.

## Project Overview

The Jupyter notebook demonstrates the process of building a regression model to estimate oil well productivity, including:
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Training and evaluating linear regression models
- Interpreting the results to understand the influence of geolocation features on oil yield

## Dataset

The dataset contains information about oil well locations and their associated characteristics, including:
- Geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude)
- Geological features (e.g., soil composition, depth)
- Historical yield data from different well sites

This data is used to train a linear regression model to predict the potential oil yield of a given location based on its features.

## Key Objectives

- **Predict oil well productivity:** Develop a regression model to estimate the yield of oil wells based on geolocation data.
- **Identify key factors influencing yield:** Analyze which geographical and geological features have the most significant impact on oil productivity.
- **Provide insights for site selection:** Use model predictions to recommend optimal drilling locations for future oil exploration.

## Machine Learning Techniques Used

The project employs several techniques for regression analysis, including:
- **Linear Regression:** For predicting oil yield based on input features
- **Data preprocessing:** Handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and encoding categorical variables
- **Feature selection:** Identifying the most relevant features affecting oil productivity
- **Model evaluation:** Using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared to assess model performance

## Tools and Libraries

The following tools and libraries are utilized:
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and preprocessing
- **Scikit-learn:** For implementing linear regression and evaluating model performance
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn:** For visualizing data distributions, model predictions, and residuals
- **NumPy:** For numerical computations
