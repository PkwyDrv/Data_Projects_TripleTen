# Age Analysis Using Computer Vision

This project focuses on using computer vision techniques to estimate the age of individuals based on facial images. The goal is to build a predictive model that can accurately determine a person's age from an image, leveraging deep learning techniques for image processing and analysis.

## Project Overview

The Jupyter notebook demonstrates the complete workflow for age estimation using computer vision, including:
- Data preprocessing and augmentation
- Building and training deep learning models for age prediction
- Evaluating model performance to ensure accurate age estimation
- Analyzing the impact of different image processing techniques on model accuracy

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains facial images labeled with the corresponding age of the individuals. The data includes:
- **Facial images:** Pictures of individuals with varying ages
- **Age labels:** The true age of the person in each image

The dataset is used to train a deep learning model that predicts the age based on the features extracted from the images.

## Key Objectives

- **Predict age from facial images:** Develop a deep learning model to estimate age accurately based on facial features.
- **Improve model performance:** Use techniques like data augmentation, hyperparameter tuning, and transfer learning to optimize the model.
- **Understand age-related features:** Analyze which facial features are most indicative of age.

## Computer Vision Techniques Used

The project employs various computer vision and deep learning techniques, including:
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** For extracting features from images and predicting age.
- **Transfer Learning:** Using pre-trained models such as VGG16 or ResNet to leverage existing knowledge and improve model performance.
- **Data Augmentation:** Techniques like rotation, scaling, and flipping to increase the diversity of the training data.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess the model's accuracy in age prediction.

## Tools and Libraries

The following tools and libraries are used in this project:
- **TensorFlow/Keras:** For building and training the deep learning models
- **OpenCV:** For image processing and manipulation
- **NumPy/Pandas:** For data handling and preprocessing
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn:** For visualizing data distributions, model performance, and results
