# Instacart Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Instacart dataset to uncover insights about customer purchasing behavior. The analysis aims to understand patterns in user orders, product preferences, and other factors influencing shopping habits.

## Project Overview

The notebook provides a thorough analysis of the Instacart dataset, including:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory analysis of customer orders and products
- Insights into user purchasing patterns
- Visualizations to highlight key trends

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is from Instacart, consisting of anonymized transactional data. It includes information about:
- Customer orders
- Products purchased
- Order sequences and timing

## Key Objectives

- **Understand customer purchasing behavior:** Identify popular products and shopping habits.
- **Examine order patterns:** Explore order frequency, timing, and basket composition.
- **Visualize key trends:** Use visualizations to present insights in a clear and interpretable manner.

## Tools and Libraries

The analysis leverages the following libraries:
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn:** For visualizations
- **NumPy:** For numerical operations

## How to Run the Notebook

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PkwyDrv/Data_Projects_TripleTen.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Data_Projects_TripleTen/EDA

3. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook EDA_Instacart.ipynb

## Findings

The notebook provides insights on:

- The distribution of products across orders
- Popular times for shopping activity
- Patterns in reorder behavior

## Future Work
Further analysis can include:

- Predictive modeling for customer behavior
- Analysis of factors driving product reorders
- Segmentation of customers based on purchasing patterns
