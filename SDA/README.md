# Hypothesis Testing Project

This project involves applying statistical hypothesis testing to real-world data in order to draw meaningful conclusions. The analysis is part of a data science bootcamp and aims to provide hands-on experience with different hypothesis testing techniques.

## Project Overview

The Jupyter notebook explores various aspects of hypothesis testing, including:
- Formulating null and alternative hypotheses
- Selecting appropriate statistical tests
- Interpreting test results
- Making data-driven decisions based on statistical evidence

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis contains sample data relevant to the hypothesis being tested. It is processed and analyzed to answer specific research questions or business problems.

## Key Objectives

- **Understand the principles of hypothesis testing:** Learn how to frame hypotheses and test them statistically.
- **Perform different types of tests:** Apply tests such as t-tests, chi-square tests, and ANOVA to analyze the data.
- **Interpret results:** Make informed conclusions based on statistical outcomes and p-values.

## Tools and Libraries

The analysis utilizes the following libraries:
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation
- **SciPy/Statsmodels:** For statistical testing
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn:** For visualizing the results

## How to Run the Notebook

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PkwyDrv/Data_Projects_TripleTen.git

2. Navigate to project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Data_Projects_TripleTen/SDA

1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook HypothesisTesting.ipynb

## Findings
The notebook includes results and interpretations for each hypothesis test performed, providing insights on:

- The significance of the tested relationships
- The practical implications of the statistical findings
  
## Future Work
Potential future directions for this project include:

- Expanding the analysis to include more complex tests
- Applying hypothesis testing to larger or different datasets
- Integrating the findings into predictive modeling
