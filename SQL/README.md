# Ride-Sharing Data Analysis Using SQL

This project analyzes ride-sharing data using SQL queries to uncover insights about ride patterns, user behavior, and business performance. The analysis focuses on querying a database to answer specific questions about the ride-sharing service's operations.

## Project Overview

The Jupyter notebook demonstrates the use of SQL for data analysis, covering:
- Connecting to a SQL database
- Writing and executing complex SQL queries
- Analyzing data to extract meaningful insights about ride-sharing trends
- Summarizing findings with visualizations based on query results

## Dataset

The dataset contains ride-sharing information, including:
- Trip details (e.g., ride start and end times, distance)
- User demographics (e.g., age, location)
- Pricing and payment information

The data has been structured in a relational database format with multiple tables.

## Key Objectives

- **Understand ride patterns:** Analyze trip frequency, duration, and distances across different user segments.
- **Evaluate business performance:** Assess metrics such as revenue, average ride cost, and user retention.
- **Examine user behavior:** Investigate user demographics and ride preferences to identify key trends.

## SQL Techniques Used

The project employs various SQL techniques, including:
- **JOIN operations:** To combine data from multiple tables
- **Aggregation functions:** Such as `SUM()`, `AVG()`, and `COUNT()` for summarizing data
- **Filtering and sorting:** Using `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, and `GROUP BY` clauses to refine results
- **Subqueries and CTEs:** For more complex data extraction

## Tools and Libraries

The project utilizes:
- **SQLite or other SQL database:** For executing SQL queries
- **Pandas:** For loading query results into dataframes for further analysis
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn:** For visualizing the insights derived from the SQL queries

## How to Run the Notebook

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PkwyDrv/Data_Projects_TripleTen.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Data_Projects_TripleTen/SQL

3. Ensure you have a compatible SQL database set up and accessible.

4. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook RideShareSQL.ipynb

5. Follow the instructions in the notebook to connect to your database and execute the queries.

## Findings
The analysis covers several key insights, including:

- Peak hours and days for ride-sharing
- Demographic groups with higher ride frequency
- Trends in average trip duration and distance
- Revenue breakdown by user segment and region
  
## Future Work
Potential future directions include:

- Automating SQL queries for real-time reporting
- Expanding the dataset to incorporate more recent or additional data sources
- Integrating machine learning models for predictive analytics based on SQL-extracted data
